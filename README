Directory structure
===================

fem3d		FEM model and utility routines
femadj		Routines for the adjustment of the grid after the
		automatic mesh generation. The program to run
		is adjele
femanim		Routines to generate animations from postscript files
fembin		Binaries used by the model
femcheck	Routines to set up and check the installation
femdoc		Documentation, manual, etc.
femersem	Routines for BFM (ERSEM) ecological model
femgotm		Routines for GOTM turbulence clousre model
femlib		Library routines (filled during compilation)
femplot		Plotting routines for post processing. The routine
		to run is plotsim, but this routine is more
		conveniently run through the command plots
femregres	Routines to do regression testing. Developers only.
femspline	Programs to smooth and reduce lines. These programs
		are used to change the resolution of the boundary
		line before running the automatic mesh generator.
		Please use the routine gridr.
grid		Visualization routine for GRD files
hcbs		Outdated files for plotting to monitor
mesh		Automatic mesh generator
post		Library for plotting to Postscript files.



Compiling the model
===================

You can compile everything from the SHYFEM directory by running the
command "make fem". Other commands are:

make help	gives help on available make targets
make fem	compiles everything
make doc	makes documentation in femdoc (manual)
make all	compiles (shyfem) and makes documents (doc)
make clean	deletes objetc and executable files in all subdirectories
make cleanall	as clean, but cleans also libraries
