directory containing files to run simulations for the tutorial

-------------------------------------------------------------------

For every simulation in the tutorial there is a *.sh file to run the simulation

e.g., for simulation mm_hyd_03.str run mm_hyd_03.sh:

./mm_hyd_03.sh

The results are plotted in files mm_hyd_03.*.ps

You can run all simulations with "./make_sims.sh"

Before running the simulations you must first run 
	"make init" to create the bas file
This has to be done only once

-------------------------------------------------------------------

simulations:

00-03

	hydrodynamic simulations with basic forcing

11-13

	hydrodynamic simulations with lateral boundary conditions

21-23

	hydrodynamic simulations with lateral boundary conditions
	and extra terms (Coriolis, advective, diffusive)

31-32

	salinity simulations (take longer)

41-43

	3d simulations (take very long)
