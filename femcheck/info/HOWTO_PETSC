HOWTO PETSC library
===============================

general info on petsc can be found here: 

	https://petsc.org/release/install/install_tutorial/
	https://petsc.org/release/faq/

The section "HOWTO install the PETSC library" is needed only if you have
to install PETSC from scratch. If, however, PETSC is already installed,
you can skip the first part of this tutorial and can go directly to
"HOWTO use the PETSC library".

Before you run shyfem with PETSC please be sure that shyfem runs
smoothly in MPI mode. For this please see HOWTO_MPI.

===============================
HOWTO install the PETSC library
===============================

download petsc from https://petsc.org/release/:

	git clone -b release https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc.git petsc

	this creates a new directory petsc with all the source code

install mpich libraries if needed (must be done as superuser):

	apt update
	apt upgrade
	apt install mpich

configure the installation:

	enter petsc directory and run

	./configure --download-fblaslapack

	or

	./configure --download-fblaslapack --with-shared-libraries=0

	if you need to use a special compiler you can specify it

	./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=gfortran \
		--download-mpich --download-fblaslapa

	for me the option --download-mpich didn't work
	I had to install mpich separately (see above)
	Use --with-shared-libraries=0 only if you have problems
		linking with shared libraries. With this option
		the executables get really big (>500MB)

compile the installation:

	follow the instructions at the end of the configuration phase

	in my case, the command to give was:
	make PETSC_DIR=/home/georg/georg/work/soft/petsc \
			PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux-c-debug all
	(the first directory is the one where petsc was installed)

check the installation:

	follow the instructions at the end of the compilation phase

	in my case, the command to give was:
	make PETSC_DIR=/home/georg/georg/work/soft/petsc \
			PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux-c-debug check

copy some files manually to the installation directory:

	in our case the installation directory is arch-linux-c-debug

	cp -au ./include/petsc arch-linux-c-debug/include
	cp -au ./include/petscversion.h arch-linux-c-debug/include

make a symbolic link from $HOME/lib/petsc to the installation directory:

	ln -fs $HOME/soft/petsc/arch-linux-c-debug $HOME/lib/petsc

===============================
HOWTO use the PETSC library
===============================

try to compile:

	cd shyfem (or whereever your shyfem installation is)
	make cleanall
	make rules_std rules_petsc
	make fem

if you get a message that PETSC_DIR is not in the library path run:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/lib/petsc/lib

	this command should be inserted into .profile or .bashrc because
	this message will also appear every time you run shyfem

try to run shyfem:

	mpirun -np 4 path_to_shyfem/shyfem str-file.str
