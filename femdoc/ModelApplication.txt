Data neede for model application
================================



GRD files
=========

all pre-processing routines work on GRD files.
These routines are:

	grid
	mesh
	reduce
	regularize

For the application of the FEM model this GRD file
has to be converted into a BAS file (see later).


BAS files
=========

The BAS file is a binary representation
of the GRD file suitable for the FEM model with re-numbered
nodes in order to optimize band width of the system matrix.
It must be produced by the program vpgrd that transforms the GRD file
into a BAS file. The FEM model only works on these binary files.


STR files
=========

STR files are the control files for the FEM model and also
for the plot routines. In these files all parameters needed
for the progam run are set. With a STR file and the data files
used for input, a simulation can be reproduced easily.


Time series files
=================

Very often the model needs time series files for input.
These files consist in its simplest form in a a file with
2 columns, where the first column represents time in seconds
and the second column represent the parameter value. This
might be the water level, the discharge etc.

Time series files can also contain more then 2 columns. For example,
the wind file contains 3 columns, where the last two columns
either represent the components of the wind speed in x and y direction
or the wind speed and direction.

The water quality model uses a time series file with 9 parameters.
Therefore the input file for the water quality program contains
10 columns (1 time column and 9 parameter columns). The meaning
of the various columns can be found in the manual or in the
header of file bio3d.f.


Output files
============

The model creates various output files. These are normally binary files
that have to be read with the appropriate programs. The meaning of
the various extensions is as follows:

EXT	extra file with time series of water levels and velocities
	in specified points ($extra in STR file)
OUS	hydrodynamic output files with a complete set of values for
	each time step written. These include the water level, the
	transports in the various layers (that can then be converted into
	velocities with the depth and the water level).
FLX	fluxes through specified sections ($flux in STR file)
NOS	Scalar nodal value files. These files contain various sets
	of values for each time step. They can be distinguished by the
	id of the scalar. Here is an (imcomplete) list of id's used
	in the program:

		10	generic concentration (tracer)
		11	salinity
		12	temperature

		18	rms (root mean square) velocity

		31	wave height
		32	wave period
		33	wave direction

		71	nh3
		72	no3
		73	opo4
		74	phyto
		75	cbod
		76	do
		77	on
		78	op
		79	zoo
