Post Processing
===============


Generation of time series
=========================

Time series can be generated with the commands splitext and splitflx.
These two commands take the files EXT and FLX and create files
z.1, z.2 etc  u.*, v.*, m.*, p.*.

	EXT file:

	z	water levels
	u	velocity in x direction
	v	velocity in y direction
	m	modulus of velocity (speed)

	FLX file:

	p	discharge

The numbers after the letter give the number of the points or the section
for which this value has been computed. Therefore, if there is the
following section in the STR file

$extra
	100 245 1243 2599
$end

flux
	0 121 134 154 0
	0 453 764 345 0
$end

then running splitext returns z.1, z.2, z.3, z.4 and similar for
u.*, v.*, m.*, where z.1 it the water level of node 100 and
z.4 the water level of node 2599.

Running splitext gives p.1 and p.2 which refer to the first and second
section in the $flux section.


Plotting time series
====================


In pricipal any program that plots time series can be used for
the generation of plots. However, in the SHYFEM framework the program
gnuplot is used to generate time series plots.

The command is gp. So, if the 4 time series of water level of the above
points have to be plotted, it is enough to write "gp z.*" which
creates a file out.ps that can be viewed with ghostview (gv).

gp -help gives the exact calling command for gp. It is possible to specify
the scaling of axes, the line type, legneds for the axis and color plots.


Plotting maps
=============


All plotting of maps can be done through the program plots. This program
calls internally the program plotsim in fem/femplot.
With this program the files *.bas, *.ous, *.nos *.con *.bio etc..
can be plotted.

With this program the following maps can be created:
	- basin (grid, bathymetry, etc..)
	- hydrodynamics: water levels, velocities, transports
	- scalar values: T/S, generic concentration, biological variables
		wave parameters, sediments, etc..

Please see "plots -help" for more information.

The program needs to know some information:

	- what to plot (-what)
	- simulation name (-bas)
	- basin name (-sim)
	- time information (-time)
	- the vertical level (-lev3d)
	- in case of scalar plotting the id of the variable (-var)
	- constrol files that specify more exactly what and how
	  the plot has to be created (please refer to the manual
	  for this part)

The easiest way to specify the simulation name and basin is through the program
"memory":

	memory -s simul		sets simulation to simul
	memory -b basnew	sets basin to basnew

In this case the names do not have to be specified in the call to plots.

Plotting for example the water levels (with simulation and basin already
specified through memory) would be:

	plots -zeta

and the barotropic velocities would be created through

	plots -vel

If velocities in different layers have to be plotted we can use

	plots -vel -lev3d 1

for the surface layer and

	plots -vel -lev3d 3

for the 3rd layer.

In the above examples all time records that are present in the output file
will be plotted. With the -time switch this behavior can be changed.
If only every 3rd record should be plotted, then "-time 3" does the
job. Giving two values sets the initial and final value of the time to be
plotted. So "-time 60000,67200" produces a plot between seconds
60000 and 67200, and "-time 60000,67200,2" does the same thing but plots
only every second record.

The switch -var defines what type of scalar has to be plotted
in case the simulation file contains more than one type.
Below some typical types are given:

		10	generic concentration (tracer)
		11	salinity
		12	temperature

		18	rms (root mean square) velocity

		31	wave height
		32	wave period
		33	wave direction

		71	nh3
		72	no3
		73	opo4
		74	phyto
		75	cbod
		76	do
		77	on
		78	op
		79	zoo

Therefore, with the command "plots -nos -var 11" the salinity
is plotted. However, for some often used parameters a specific
switch exists for the plotting:

	plots -conz	generic concentration
	plots -salt	salinity
	plots -temp	temperature
	plots -rms	rms velocity


Example of creating graphics
============================

memory -s test01  -b hue3

splitext
gp z.*
	-> in out.ps are water level time series
splitflx
gp p.*
	-> in out.ps are discharge time series

plots -bath
	-> in plot.ps is grid and bathymetry

plots -zeta
	-> in plot.ps is water level

plots -vel -lev3d 1
	-> in plot.ps is surface layer velocity of current

plots -salt -lev3d 3
	-> in plot.ps is salinity of 3rd layer
