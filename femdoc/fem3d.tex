\chapter{Introduction}


The finite element program \shy{} is a program package that can be used
to resolve the hydrodynamic equations in lagoons, coastal seas,
estuaries and lakes. The program uses finite elements for the
resolution of the hydrodynamic equations. These finite elements,
together with an effective semi-implicit time resolution algorithm,
makes this program especially suitable for application to a complicated
geometry and bathymetry.

This version of the program \shy{} resolves the depth integrated
shallow water equations. It is therefore recommended for the
application of very shallow basins or well mixed estuaries. Storm surge
phenomena can be investigated also.  This two-dimensional version of
the program is not suited for the application to baroclinic driven
flows or large scale flows where the the Coriolis acceleration is
important.

Finite elements are superior to finite differences when dealing with
complex bathymetric situations and geometries. Finite differences are
limited to a regular outlay of their grids. This will be a problem if
only parts of a basin need high resolution.  The finite element method
has an advantage in this case allowing more flexibility with its
subdivision of the system in triangles varying in form and size.

This model is especially adapted to run in very shallow basins. It is
possible to simulate shallow water flats, i.e., tidal marshes that in a
tidal cycle may be covered with water during high tide and then fall
dry during ebb tide. This phenomenon is handled by the model in a mass
conserving way.

Finite element methods have been introduced into hydrodynamics since
1973 and have been extensively applied to shallow water equations by
numerous authors \cite{Grotkop73, Taylor75, Herrling77, Herrling78, Holz82}.

The model presented here \cite{Umgies86, Umgies93} uses the mathematical
formulation of the semi-implicit algorithm that decouples the solution
of the water levels and velocity components from each other leading to
smaller systems to solve. Models of this type have been presented from
1971 on by many authors \cite{Kwizak71, Duwe82, Backhaus83}.

\input{equat.tex}

\chapter{Pre-Processing}


The pre-processing routine |vp| is used to generate an
optimized version of the file that describes the basin
where the main program is to be run. In the following a
short introduction in using this program is given.

\section{The pre-processing routine {\tt vp}}

The main routine |hp| reads the basin file generated by
the pre-processing routine |vp| and uses it as the description
of the domain where the hydrodynamic equations have to be
solved.

The program |vp| is started by typing |vp| on the command line.
From this point on the program is interactive, asking you about
the basin file name and other options. Please follow the online
instructions.

The routine |vp| reads a file of type GRD. This type of file
can be generated and manipulated by the program |grid| which
is not described here. In short, the file GRD consists of
nodes and elements that describe the geometrical layout
of the basin. Moreover, the elements have a type and a depth.

The depth is needed by the main program |hp| to run the model.
The type of the element is used by |hp| to determine
the friction parameter on the bottom, since this parameter
may be assigned differently, depending on the various situations
of the bottom roughness.

This file GRD is read by |vp| and transformed into an
unformatted file BAS. It is this file that is then read
by the main routine |hp|. Therefore, if the name of the
basin is |lagoon|, then the file GRD is called |lagoon.grd|
and the output of the pre-processing routine |vp| is
called |lagoon.bas|.

The program |vp| normally uses the depths assigned to the
elements in the file GRD to determine the depth of the
finite elements to use in the program |hp|. In the case
that these depth values are not complete, and that all nodes
have depths assigned in the GRD file, the nodal values of the
depths are used and interpolated onto the elements. However,
if also these nodal depth values are incomplete or are missing
altogether, the program terminates with an error.

\section{Optimization of the bandwidth}

The main task of routine |vp| is the optimization of the 
internal numbering of the nodes and elements.
Re-numbering the elements is just a mere convenience. When
assembling the system matrix the contribution of
one element after the other has to be added to the system matrix.
If the elements are numbered in terms of lowest node numbers,
then the access of the nodal pointers is more regular in 
computer memory and paging is more likely to be inhibited.

However, re-numbering the nodes is absolutely necessary.
The system matrix to be solved is of band-matrix type.
I.e., non-zero entries are all concentrated along the
main diagonal in a more or less narrow band. The larger this
band is, the larger the amount of cpu time spent to
solve the system. The time to solve a band matrix
is of order $n \cdot m^2$, where $n$ is the size of the
matrix and $m$ is the bandwidth. Note that $m$ is normally
much smaller than $n$.

If the nodes are left with the original numbering, it is very likely
that the bandwidth is very high, unless the nodes in the
file GRD are by chance already optimized. Since the bandwidth $m$
is entering the above formula quadratically, the amount
of time spent solving the matrix will be prohibitive.
E.g., halving the bandwidth will speed up computations by
a factor of 4.

The bandwidth is equal to the maximum difference of node numbers
in one element. It is therefore important to re-number the
nodes in order to minimize this number. However, there exist
only heuristic algorithms for the minimization of this number.

The two main algorithms used in the routine |vp| are
the Cuthill McGee algorithm and the algorithm of Rosen. The first
one, starting from one node, tries to number all neighbors in
a greedy way, optimizing only this step. From the points
numbered in this step, the next neighbors are numbered.

This procedure is tried from more than one node, possibly
from all boundary nodes. The numbering resulting from this
algorithm is normally very good and needs only slight
enhancements to be optimum.

Once all nodes are numbered, the Rosen algorithm tries to
exchange these node numbers, where the highest difference
can be found. This normally gives only a slight improvement
of the bandwidth. It has been seen, however, that, if the
node numbers coming out from the Cuthill McGee algorithm
are reversed, before feeding them into the Rosen algorithm, 
the results tend to be slightly better. This step is also
performed by the program.

All these steps are performed by the program without
intervention by the operator, if the automatic optimization
of bandwidth is chosen in the program |vp|. The choices
are to not perform the bandwidth optimization at all
(GRD file has already optimized node numbering), perform
it automatically or perform it manually. It is suggested
to always perform automatic optimization of the bandwidth.
This choice will lead to a nearly optimum numbering of the
nodes and will be by all means good results.

If, however, you decide to do a manual optimization, please
follow the online instructions in the program.

\section{Internal and external node numbering}

As explained above, the elements and nodes of the basin are re-numbered 
in order to optimize the bandwidth of the system matrix and so
the execution speed of the program. 

However, this re-numbering of the node and elements is transparent
to the user. The program keeps pointers from the original numbering
(external numbers) to the optimized numbering (internal numbers).
The user has to deal only with external numbers, even if the 
program uses internally the other number system.

Moreover, the internal numbers are generated consecutively.
Therefore, if there are a total of 4000 nodes in the system, the internal
nodes run from 1 to 4000. The external node numbers,
on the other side, can be anything the user likes. They just must be
unique. This allows for insertion and deletion of nodes without
having to re-number over and over again the basin.

The nodes that have to be specified in the input parameter file
use again external numbers. In this way, changing the structure of
the basin does not at all change the node and element numbers in the
input parameter file. Except in the case, where modifications
actually touch nodes and elements that are specified in the 
parameter file.



\chapter{The Model}

In the following an overview is given on running the model
\shy{}. The model needs a parameter input file that is read 
on standard input. Moreover, it needs some external files that
are specified in this parameter input file. The model produces
several external files with the results of the simulation. Again,
the name of this files can be influenced by the parameter input file


\section{The Parameter Input File}

The model reads one input file that determines the behavior of the
simulation. All possible parameters can and must be set in this file.
If other data files are to be read, here is the place where to specify
them.

The model reads this parameter file from standard input. Thus, if
the model binary is called |hp| and the parameter file |param.str|, 
then the following line starts the simulation
\begin{verbatim}
	hp < param.str
\end{verbatim}
and runs the model.

\subsection{The General Structure of the Parameter Input File}

The input parameter file is the file that guides program
performance. It contains all necessary information for the main routine
to execute the model. Nearly all parameters that can
be given have a default value which is used when the parameter
is not listed in the file. Only some time parameters are compulsory
and must be present in the file.

The format of the file looks very like a namelist format, but is
not dependent on the compiler used. Values of parameters are given
in the form :  
|name = value|  or  |name = 'text'|.  If |name|
is an array the following format is used : 
\begin{verbatim}
          name = value1 , value2, ... valueN
\end{verbatim}
The list can continue on the following lines. Blanks before and after
the equal sign are ignored. More then one parameter can be present
on one line. As separator blank, tab and comma can be used.

Parameters, arrays and data must be given in between certain sections.
A section starts with the character {\tt \$} followed by a keyword and
ends with {\tt \$end}. The {\tt \$keyword} and {\tt \$end} must not
contain any blank characters and must be the first non blank characters
in the line. Other characters following the keyword on the same line
separated by a valid separator are ignored.

Several sections of data may be present in the input parameter file.
Further ahead all sections are presented and the possible
parameters that can be specified are explained. The sequence in
which the sections appear is of no importance. However, the first 
section must always be section |\$title|, the section that
determines the name of simulation and the basin file to use and
gives a one line description of the simulation.

Lines outside of the sections are ignored. This gives
the possibility to comment the parameter input file.

Figure \ref{fig:str_example} shows an example of a typical input
parameter file and the use of the sections and definition of
parameters.

\begin{figure}
\begin{alltt}
\input{example.str}
\end{alltt}
\caption{Example of a parameter input file ({\tt STR} file)}
\label{fig:str_example}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Typical Usage of the model}

\input{usage.tex}

\subsection{The Single Sections of the Parameter Input File}

\subsubsection{Section {\tt \$title}}

This section must be always the first section in the parameter input file.
It contains only three lines. An example is given in 
figure \ref{fig:titleexample}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{verbatim}
$title
        free one line description of simulation
        name_of_simulation
        name_of_basin
$end
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Example of section {\tt \$title}}
\label{fig:titleexample}
\end{figure}

The first line of this section is a free one line description of
the simulation that is to be carried out. The next line contains
the name of the simulation (in this case |name_of_simulation|).
All created files will use this name in the main part of the file name
with different extensions. Therefore the hydrodynamic output file
(extension |out|) will be named |name_of_simulation.out|.
The last line gives the name of the basin file to be used. This
is the pre-processed file of the basin with extension |bas|.
In our example the basin file |name_of_basin.bas| is used.

The directory where this files are read from or written to depends
on the settings in section {\tt \$name}. Using the default
the program will read from and write to the current directory.

\subsubsection{Section {\tt \$para}}

This section defines the general behavior of the simulation,
gives various constants of parameters and determines what
output files are written. In the following the meaning of
all possible parameters is given.

Note that the only compulsory parameters in this section are 
the ones that chose the duration of the simulation and the
integration time step. All other parameters are optional.

\input{S_para_h.tex}

\subsubsection{Section {\tt \$name}}

In this sections names of directories or input files can be
given. All directories default to the current directory,
whereas all file names are empty, i.e., no input files are
given.

\input{S_name.tex}
\input{S_name_h.tex}

\subsubsection{Section {\tt \$bound}}

\input{S_bound.tex}


\subsubsection{Section {\tt \$wind}}

\input{S_wind.tex}



\subsubsection{Section {\tt \$extra}}

In this section the node numbers of so called ``extra'' points are given. 
These are points where water level and velocities are written to create
a time series that can be elaborated later. The output for these ``extra''
points consumes little memory and can be therefore written with a
much higher frequency (typically the same as the integration time step)
than the complete hydrodynamical output. The output is written
to file EXT.

The node numbers are specified in a free format on one ore more lines.
An example can be seen in figure \ref{fig:str_example}. No keywords
are expected in this section.


\subsubsection{Section {\tt \$flux}}

In this section transects are specified through which the discharge
of water is computed by the program and written to file FLX.
The transects are defined by their nodes through which they run.
All nodes in one transect must be adjacent, i.e., they must form a
continuous line in the FEM network.

The nodes of the transects are specified in free format. Between
two transects one or more 0's must be inserted. An example is given in
figure \ref{fig:fluxexample}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{verbatim}
$flux
	1001 1002 1004 0
	35 37 46 0 0 56 57 58 0
	407
	301
	435 0 89 87
$end
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Example of section {\tt \$flux}}
\label{fig:fluxexample}
\end{figure}

The example shows the definition of 5 transects. As can be seen, the 
nodes of the transects can be given on one line alone (first transect),
two transects on one line (transect 2 and 3), spread over more lines
(transect 4) and a last transect.


\chapter{Post-Processing}


There are several routines that do a post-processing of the results of the 
main routine. The most important are described in this chapter.
Note that in the model framework no program is supplied to do
time series plots. However, there are utility routines that will extract
data from the output files. These data will be written in a way
that it can be imported into a spreadsheet or any other plotting
program that does the nice plotting.


\section{Plotting of maps with {\tt plotmap}}

\subsection{The parameter input file for {\tt plotmap}}

The format of the parameter input file is the same as the one for
the main routine. Please see this section for more information
on the format of the parameter input file.

Some sections of the parameter input file are identical to the 
sections used in the main routine. For easier reference we will
repeat the possible parameters of these section here.


\subsubsection{Section {\tt \$title}}

This section must be always the first section in the parameter input file.
It contains only three lines. An example has been given already in 
figure \ref{fig:titleexample}.

The only difference respect to the {\tt \$para} section of the main routine
is the first line. Here any description of the output can be used.
It is just a way to label the parameter file.
The other two line with the name of simulation and the basin are used
to open the files needed for plotting.
