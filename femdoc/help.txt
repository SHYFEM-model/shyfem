The input parameter file is the file that guides program
performance. It containes all necessary information for the main routine
to execute the model. Nearly all parameters that can
be given have a default value which is used when the parameter
is not listed in the file. Only some time parameters are compulsory
and must be present in the file.

The format of the file looks very like a namelist format, but is
not dependent on the compiler used. Values of parameters are given
in the form :  
|name = value|  or  |name = 'text'|.  If |name|
is an array the following format is used : 
|name = value1 , value2, ... valueN|.
The list can continue on the following lines. Blanks befor and after
the equal sign are ignored. More then one parameter can be present
on one line. As seperator blank, tab and comma can be used.

Parameters, arrays and data must be given inbetween certain sections.
A section starts with the character {\tt $} followed by a keyword
and ends with {\tt $end}. {\tt $keyword} and {\tt $end} must not contain
any blank characters and must be the first
non blank characters in the line. Other characters following
the keyword on the same line seperated by a valid seperator are ignored.

Several sections of data may be present in the input parameter file.
Further ahead all sections are presented and the possible
parameters that can be specified are explained.

Lines outside of the sections are ignored. This gives
the possibility to comment the parameter input file.

Figure 1 shows an example of a typical input parameter file
and the use of the sections and definition of parameters.

.header level 2 section PARA


.header level 2 section EXTRA

The node numbers of the extra points have to be specified here.
Output for these extra points is written every time step to file 7.
Format of this section is :
.b
IEXTRA1,IEXTRA2,...IEXTRAN
.b
where N is the number of the points given.

.header level 2 section CHEZY

In this section to the various areas defined in file 3 can
be associated the corresponding Chezy values. The format for the 
input is :
.b;.lt
	AREA0 CHEZYa0 CHEZYb0 NODEa0 NODEb0
	AREA1 CHEZYa1 CHEZYb1 NODEa1 NODEb1
	...
	AREAn CHEZYan CHEZYbn NODEan NODEbn
.el;.b
where AREA is the area code (0-n), CHEZYa is the main Chezy value
associated with the area code, CHEZYb is the second Chezy value
for the area code. CHEZYb is compulsory, but if present then also
NODEa and NODEb must be present. If the flow is in the direction of
NODEa to NODEb then
CHEZYa is used, else CHEZYb is used. If CHEZYb is not present
thenCHEZYa is used for all situations.

.header level 2 section FILE

File names for external files.
.b
.ls 1,"-"
.le;BOUND###file name of initial water level distribution (default=' ').
For the format of the file see file 10.
.le;WIND####file name of wind data (default=' '). For the format of
the file see file 15.
.le;FDNAME##file name of initial particle coordinates for float
diffusion routine (default=' '). For the format of
the file see file 17.
.els


.header level 2 section BOUND

This section defines the boundary conditions for the open boundaries.
There are as many sections BOUND as there are open boundaries.
Every new section has to be opened by $BOUND<number> where number is
the number of the inlet. The numbers must be contigous starting
from 1. Thus the first boundary section would be opened by $BOUND1
and the last by $BOUND4 assuming 4 inlets.
.b
Normally the boundary conditions are read from an external file
given in BOUNDN. But if BOUNDN=' ' then the program uses
a sinusoidal input that can be tuned by the parameters 
AMPLI, PERIOD, PHASE and ZREF. If a file name is given
in BOUNDN these parameters are of no importance.

.b
.ls 1,"-"
.le;BOUNDN##name of the file in which the boundary values
can be found (default=' '). for more information on the
format of the file see file 30.. in the chapter about
external files.
.le;KBOUND##array of the boundary node numbers the boundary consists off.
At least two nodes must be given in this array. The order of the
nodes for one inlet must be anti-clockwise e.g. the elements must
be to the left of the line defined by the nodes.
.le;IQUAL###same boundary condition as other inlet (default=0).
If IQUAL=0 all boundary conditions may be given for this inlet,
else IQUAL is the number of the inlet where the boundary
conditions have to be taken from. The number of the other inlet must 
be less then the actual inlet number. This parameter is
used if two inlets have exactly the same boundary conditions to
avoid the doubling of the boundary file because only one
inlet can read its data from a file with boundary data.
.le;IFLUX###type of boundary (default=0). If IFLUX=0 on the
boundary the water levels are specified, if IFLUX=1 the
discharges have to be given.
.le;AMPLI###amplitude of sinusoidal input (default=0.)
.le;PERIOD##period of sinusoidal input (default=12*3600).
.le;PHASE###initial phase of sinusoidal input (default=0.).
.le;ZREF####reference level (bias) of sinusoidal input (default=0.).
.els

.header level 2 section FLOAT

This section specifies the input for the float tracking mechanism.
Only the initial locations of the particles have to be given in the form:
.b
X1, Y1, X2, Y2, ...Xn, Yn
.b
where X, Y are the initial coordinates of the particle and n is the
total number of particles given (see NFLOAT in /FLOAT/).
