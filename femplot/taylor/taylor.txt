c This files contains utility routines to generate a Taylor
c diagram as described in
"Taylor, K. E., Summarizing multiple
aspects of model performance in a single diagram, JGR, 106 (D7),
7183-7192, 2001."
A short description of how to use the routines is given below.
A short example of usage can be found at the end of this file
in the routine "taylor_example". Uncommenting the last three
lines in this file the example can be tested.

The plotting session must be opened by a call to "qopen" and
must be closed with "qclose". In between the plotting session
multiple taylor diagrams can be plotted. Every diagram will be
plotted on a new page, and must be bracketed by calls to
"taylor_start" and "taylor_end". Therefore, a session for
producing two taylor diagrams will be:

        call qopen

        call taylor_start
        ...
        call taylor_end

        call taylor_start
        ...
        call taylor_end

        call qclose

where ... denotes the real plotting described below.

The following subroutines are available:

	subroutine taylor_set_param(sigma_tot,sigma_r,d_sigma,ndec)
        real sigma_tot      !maximum of sigma to plot
        real sigma_r        !sigma of reference point
        real d_sigma        !plot marker every d_s sigma
        integer ndec        !decimals for sigma value

        subroutine taylor_set_config(bstd,bcor,brms)
        logical bstd            !plot lines for standard deviation
        logical bcor            !plot lines for correlation coefficient
        logical brms            !plot lines for RMS error

	subroutine taylor_set_text(std_text,cor_text)
        character*(*) std_text         !text to be written for std
        character*(*) cor_text         !text to be written for cor

        subroutine taylor_full		!plot full circle (really half)
        subroutine taylor_quart		!plot a quarter of a circle

        subroutine taylor_data(sigma_f,r_corr,text)	!writes text centered
        subroutine taylor_point(sigma_f,r_corr,text)	!writes text with point
