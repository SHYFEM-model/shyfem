find elements by number from keyboard -> bug
	(el 430 or 740 with venlag61)
	-> probably due to roundoff errors passing from 
	float to int to float
	-> call Tentative directly

	similar element 14356 of rosa27.grd

* (not necessary) giving depth by element -> interpolate to nodes

* exit - cancel - exit exits the program

* passage to more than 3 vertices :
	WriteToMesWindow -> think about something better
	317 in gridhs ???
	CheckConnection
	is AreaElement ok ?
	InvertIndex ?
	maximum for element vetices -> handle more kindly
		(ELEMNODE_DIM...)
	look also for lines (vertex=2) in FindElement

* does not find identical elements -> control

* segmentation fault when plotting with colors

* may be a new structure -> line (consisting of many nodes , not closed contour)

* if nothing read, clicking in plot window gives a segmentation fault

* do not ask for filename, if nothing changed

* write comments

specify colors for different types 

* new default file type is 0

* check use of nodes only with option

minimum vertices : for line 2 (closed contour 4)   for elem 3
                       ^       ^                   ^
                       done    ????                done

splitline : increment use for node where splitted (may already done?)

move node : plot new line (?)

better way of finding line (jump to nearest point)

* if nothing, clicking in plot window gives segmentaion fault (?)

* Change : must operate also on nodes and lines depending on
	show type chosen

* Complete new Menu system : Menu bar, Pop up, Drag down

in graph : - get back Biggest Viewport useable (as in X11)
		-> change fixed values in gridmu.c
	   - include Save/RestorePixels as functions

* files not needed : gridma.c, gridgg.c, gridhs1.c, readgrd.c

for new version :

save, print, make element/line without existing nodes, change

* do not make element with only 2 nodes
* do not make element with double nodes

avoid blinking on Maximizing window 
	-> XCheckTypedEvent, XCheckMaskEvent

buttons get smaller after max and minimizing area 
if window too small -> will not plot anything anymore

accept DEL from keyboard

find good way to write float to message window (not too many decimals)

set AREAMIN in relation to min/max of nodes

* do not accept element with only two nodes

* handle elements with not unique nodes gracefully

colortable size of 2 gives segmentation fault

new command : 
	- Unify node -> to melt two nodes in one
	- Save (in file menu)

Number_list_type -> only used in gridhs
	maybe substitute with Numbertable_type
	(maybe Coord_type also ?)

in GfMakeElement/Line -> substitute static array with
	dynamically allocated nodes !!

InElement only for convex area -> extend to any area

do not accept line with only one vertex at read
	(closed contour ???)

* zoom window with same point -> floating point exception

* size of cross for single points

* elements with null depth -> gray (gridco.c, gridpl.c)

Nodelist, NTotList, NODELIST_DIM -> make better
	(creating element/line)

DOS/UNIX needed ? (may be substitute)

options :
	- n,e,l,v to start up in node/element/line/vector mode
	- to use nodal depths for colors

* use in Node_type -> put in extra slot

clean from following routines and items :
	- Fence, FENCE_DIM, DelBlock, Undo...
	- Chart
	- Wind, OpWind (grid, bu, mu, ma2, op, ut)
	- level

plot line while creating

adjust vector according to given direction

change type also for vectors

implement special keyboard keys for tcc - and linux X11

move element

move line

close line

============================================================

for new version...

move MakeGridMenu() to subroutine
eliminate XctX/Y, ActMode, ActString
ProcessMenuInput() should be called from a more general routine
menu routines in more than one file -> menu, pulldown, ...
	general event loop
	layout item 
	make plotfield a canvas
screen -> rewrite to use directly integer coordinates for plotting
spurious lines in popping up of second pulldown
	-> also after a redraw event
